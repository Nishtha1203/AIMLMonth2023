Summary(Optional) :   In this dataset ( Company Bankruptcy Pediction), there were 2 tasks allotted to us. The first one was the EDA (Exploratory data analysis) wherein we were given 5 questions about the dataset and we had to find the results. The second task was to perform the classification (and implement Data Preprocessing (as per requirement), Feature Engineering, Split dataset in train-test (80:20 ratio), Model selection, Model training, Model evaluation, Fine-tune the Model, Make predictions) of records into the mentioned classes that are Bankrupt or Non-Bankrupt. I have used Logistic Regression Model for classification purpose, wherein I found that the accuracy of the model is 0.952 ( using score() function).
